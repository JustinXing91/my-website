    <p>When it comes to the life of studying abroad, I have caught a good opportunity. Just like many students who have the idea of studying abroad, studying abroad is no longer a dream. After I graduated from junior high school, I was encouraged by my parents to study in the United States. Can I cope with all kinds of unimaginable situations independently? But without the shackles of my parents, I was finally free, and who knows how much freedom I need to give up behind this "freedom". If you are scared or confused by me, simply take an example -- read books! Each course involves reading several books, dozens or even hundreds of pages a week.
<br>  After these years of ups and downs come, I experienced a person's life hard, also tasted the confidence brought by independence. To study by oneself, facing a strange country, strange people, and strange culture, in fact, every foreign student has unspeakable sweet, sweet, bitter and spicy psychology. But at the same time, because of this difference, let me realize that the essence of education is not achievement, but understanding the world, establish a complete and correct values, outlook on life, let their own life in their own hands. None of us would have learned to take charge of our own lives without such a chance to be "independent" and "free." It is precisely because of such an environment that we have seen the "outside" world. We have honed our will and exercised our ability to take care of ourselves in various aspects. What's more, I have learned how to plan so that I can become a better person and have a better future.</p>
